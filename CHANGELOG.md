# Changelog

## [1.2.1] - 18/03/2026

### Changed

- **Async Postgres data store** — rewrote `PostgresDataStore` to use SQLAlchemy's async engine (`create_async_engine`, `AsyncSession`, `async_sessionmaker`). All database I/O is now non-blocking, eliminating event-loop stalls in async environments.
- **Explicit configuration** — `PostgresDataStore` now takes `database_url` and `pool_size` as constructor arguments instead of reading `DATABASE_URL` / `POOL_SIZE` from environment variables at module level. No more hidden `load_dotenv()` side-effect on import.
- **Removed pool-size validation** — dropped the startup `SHOW max_connections` check and the `get_max_db_connections` utility. Pool sizing is now the caller's responsibility.
- **Bumped SQLAlchemy minimum** to `>=2.0.0` (required for `async_sessionmaker`).
- **Added `asyncpg`** driver dependency (`>=0.29.0,<1`).
- `list_run_steps` and `get_run_step_by_id` are now properly `async`.
- Removed duplicate `purge_expired` method.
- `close()` is now an async method (`await store.close()`) that disposes the engine cleanly.
- Add missing database migrations version.
- Updated logging in llamphouse to allow propagation to root logger for unified output, and set uvicorn access logger to not propagate to avoid duplicate logs.

## [1.2.0] - 16/03/2026

### Added

- **Pluggable adapter architecture** — the API layer is now built on `BaseAPIAdapter`. The OpenAI-compatible routes are wrapped in `AssistantAPIAdapter`, making it easy to mount additional protocols alongside each other.
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) adapter** — new `A2AAdapter` exposes agents over the Google A2A protocol, supporting task lifecycle, streaming via SSE, and push-notification callbacks.
- **Compass developer dashboard** — built-in Vue SPA served at `/compass` for inspecting agents, threads, runs, traces, and config in real time. Mountable as an adapter or run standalone via `llamphouse compass`.
- **Dashboard adapter** — lightweight `DashboardAdapter` at `/_dashboard` for minimal operational endpoints.
- **CLI (`llamphouse`)** — new command-line interface with `serve`, `worker`, and `compass` sub-commands. Supports `--host`, `--port`, `--no-workers`, and `--ws` flags.
- **Config store** — `BaseConfigStore` / `InMemoryConfigStore` for runtime-tunable agent parameters (`NumberParam`, `StringParam`, `PromptParam`, `BooleanParam`, `SelectParam`).
- **Distributed worker mode** — `DistributedWorker` consumes runs from a Redis-backed queue and publishes SSE events via Redis Pub/Sub, enabling horizontal scaling across multiple processes.
- **Redis queue** — `RedisQueue` implementation using Redis Streams with consumer groups for reliable, distributed run dispatch.
- **Redis event queue** — `RedisEventQueue` for cross-process SSE event delivery between workers and API pods.
- **Rich message parts** — `TextPart`, `ImagePart`, `FilePart`, and `DataPart` types for structured multi-modal message content.
- **WebSocket protocol flag** — `ignite()` and the CLI now accept a `--ws` parameter (forwarded to uvicorn) to select the WebSocket implementation (e.g. `websockets-sansio`).
- **Docker support** — added `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `docker-compose.prod.yml` for containerised deployments with OpenTelemetry Collector sidecar.
- **MkDocs documentation site** — full docs covering installation, quickstart, concepts (agents, adapters, context, multi-agent), guides (streaming, tool calls, tracing, config store, compass), deployment, and API compatibility.
- **New examples** — reorganised and expanded to 10 examples: HelloWorld, Chat, Streaming, ToolCall, OrchestratorAgent, AgentHandover, Tracing, ConfigStore, CustomAuth, and DistributedWorker.

### Changed

- **Refactored package layout** — moved from flat `llamphouse/core/` to `llamphouse/llamphouse/core/` with proper namespacing.
- **Adapter initialisation** — passing an explicit `adapters` list to `LLAMPHouse()` now means "use exactly these"; Compass is only auto-mounted when `adapters` is omitted.
- **Bumped dependency bounds** — `uvicorn >=0.35.0,<1.0` (was `<0.41`), `fastapi >=0.100.0,<1.0` (was `<0.130`), `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi >=0.60b0,<1.0` (was `<0.61`).
- **Stable Compass build output** — Vite now produces hash-free filenames for clean git diffs.
- **Auth system expanded** — `BaseAuth` now returns an `AuthResult` with richer context; added `KeyAuth` convenience implementation.
- **Context API extended** — additional helpers for tool-call steps, message insertion, and run/thread metadata updates.

### Fixed

- Compass adapter no longer silently injects itself when a custom `adapters` list is provided.

## [1.1.0] - 02/02/2026

- Added end-to-end tracing across the LLAMPHouse system.
- Consistent span naming and GenAI attributes for observability.
- Input/output payload attributes to surface request/response data in traces.
- Environment-based tracing configuration (enable/disable + exporter setup).
- Example configuration for tracing with OTEL/Langfuse.

## [1.0.1] - 29/1/2026

* Fixed the initial migration version chain (base revision alignment).
* Standardized timezone handling: run_steps now migrate to tz‑aware timestamps consistently.

## [1.0.0] - 9/1/2026

### Added

- Introduced a pluggable data_store architecture with in-memory and Postgres backends.
- Added event queues with in-memory and Janus implementations.
- Added streaming adapters for OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic.
- Added **Data Retention Policy** support with automated purge functionality for both In-Memory and Postgres backends.
- Added a **Tox compatibility matrix** to ensure stable performance across multiple dependency versions (FastAPI 0.100.0 to latest).
- Added a comprehensive **Purge Example** demonstrating data lifecycle management.
- Added **GeminiStreaming example** demonstrating real-time output integration with the new pluggable streaming architecture.

### Changed

- **Refactored API lifecycle management**: Migrated from deprecated `startup`/`shutdown` events to the modern FastAPI `lifespan` context manager for improved resource handling.
- Updated examples to align with the new pluggable backend/streaming flow.
